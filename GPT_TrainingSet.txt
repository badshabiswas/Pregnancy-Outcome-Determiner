I am overwhelmed with joy as my little one has finally arrived! Weighing 7 pounds and 7 ounces, and measuring 20 inches in length, I am completely smitten.	1

My scheduled induction for today at 5 pm was unexpectedly cancelled. However, since my due date is in 10 days, my baby could arrive at any time.	1
There is no consistent pattern for when the baby will arrive, but I wouldn't mind if she came now. I will be 38 weeks pregnant tomorrow.	1
I am feeling extremely frustrated as my expected delivery date has arrived, but there are no indications that the baby is coming any time soon.	1
She weighed 6lbs 9oz when she was born, but now she only weighs 15 lbs.	1
I am feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to cope with my current state of being as there are numerous body parts inside me, with only four days remaining until my baby's due date.	1
I can't believe it's only 8 days until my baby is due! I'm not exactly sure what that means, but I'm not stressing about it because I have decided to let go and go with the flow.	1
I'm feeling quite uncertain if my baby received the message that it's supposed to arrive tomorrow. Typically, none of my previous pregnancies had the baby come before the due date. This is definitely a pregnancy problem.	1
